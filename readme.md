To test this out on **your own remix** of the [original project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/509531164/), edit `index.js` and replace the following info object attributes with your username, password and remixed project ID:
```
const info = {
    username: "ilhp10",
    password: "its a secret!!!",
    projectId: "509531164"
}
```
Then, open your terminal and install the node modules:

```bash
npm i
```

Finally, run the node code!

```bash
node .
```
